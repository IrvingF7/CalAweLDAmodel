07/19/2018:
1. Fix the function for rendering top representative narratives for each topic.
2. Improve the folder structure of the project.
3. Add the file of CATALOG.txt to keep track of the structure of the program, and UPDATE_LOG.txt to keep track of the version change.
4. Add more customization possibilities to the project. Specifically:
(1): Now you can just change the parameter of the language in the top of the code to handle different language data.
(2): You can change the number of topics generated from the data
(3): You can specify how many representative narrative you want to find for each topic
5. Make the program read the translation instead of just the narrative if the language is not English.
6. Update the README.txt for how to play with the parameters for customization.
